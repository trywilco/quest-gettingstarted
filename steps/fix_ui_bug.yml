          - text: Great. best time to solve this bug is exactly, well, now!
          - text: "- As we understood earlier, when an no url is provided for the image source, we'll have a broken image tag rendered."
          - text: |
              - How can we handle it? On the frontend, the easiest trick would be to check if a no image URL was provided, and replace it with our placeholder!
                A great solutin here is also a simple one, we can set a fallback image `src` like so: `src={item.image || placeholderImage}`
          - text: |
               Once you do that, the item preview should look like this:

          - text: Much better, isn't it? Now all you have to do is follow my lead, fix this in your environment, and submit a pull request!
